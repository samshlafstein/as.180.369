One significant way AI could help improve my paper is by assisting in modeling, coding, and suggesting regressions. In the past, I have used AI to work through coding errors. I have also used it in cases where my regression output looks astray, and it has identified potential errors such as multicollinearity and ways to work around them, like creating a correlation matrix. The AI can also suggest trying different models, e.g., OLS vs. GLS. 

Another way the AI can help is by improving the logical flow of my paper. We have done this in the past on a smaller scale. Still, I imagine that as the paperâ€™s length and complexity increase, having a way to check your introduction ideas logically becomes even more valuable and important. 

Another application of AI is using it to help with graph readability/interpretation. The recorded lecture we watched in class emphasized the visual importance of graphs, mentioning granular details like how specific colors (using blue/red in graphs comparing across US party lines). AI could not only suggest ways to improve readability but also help generate code to bring more complicated graph ideas to life.
