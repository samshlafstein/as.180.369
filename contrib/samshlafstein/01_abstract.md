This paper analyzes how climate-induced weather affects electricity consumption in Texas. It uses data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and economic indicators from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The study compares historical data from the years 1960 to 1980 with data from 2022 using a Random Forest regression model to isolate the effects of climate change. The model incorporates heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), population, GDP, and a time trend, capturing the relevant variables that influence electricity consumption. By evaluating the difference between predictions generated by data trained on the "pre-climate change" period and the actual more recent data, we gain insight into the impacts of climate change on energy consumption. Key findings indicate that the model's prediction for 2022 was approximately 36% off from actual consumption, highlighting the increased energy demand driven by more extreme weather patterns resulting from climate change.
