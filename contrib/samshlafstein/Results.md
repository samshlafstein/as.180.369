### Results

This analysis utilized a fixed-effects regression model to examine electricity demand in Texas from 1950 to 1980 and subsequently tested the model's predictive accuracy using data from 2021 to 2023. The findings shed light on the model's capacity to elucidate the relationships among climatic variables, socio-economic factors, electricity trading, and evolving electricity demand.

#### Model Training (1950-1980)

The regression model demonstrated statistically significant coefficients for Heating Degree Days (HDD) and Cooling Degree Days (CDD) during the historical period. The CDD coefficient was 0.38, indicating a 0.38% increase in electricity demand per additional cooling degree day. Similarly, the HDD coefficient was 0.28, reflecting a 0.28% increase in electricity demand for each heating degree day.

#### Model Testing (2021-2023)

The model's predictive accuracy was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), yielding a value of 0.42. This moderate RMSE suggests that while the model derived from historical data retained some relevance, it experienced discrepancies, highlighting potential shifts in the relationships influenced by contemporary climatic and socio-economic changes.

#### Comparison of Historical and Current Periods

A comparative analysis of the 1950-1980 and 2021-2023 periods revealed significant differences in electricity demand patterns. The model consistently underestimated current demand, averaging a 7% underprediction. This discrepancy is likely attributable to the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events linked to climate change, which were less prevalent in the earlier timeframe.
