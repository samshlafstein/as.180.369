**Conclusion**

This study offers a new approach to predicting electricity consumption in the context of climate variability, moving beyond the traditional regression models commonly used in this field. By implementing a Random Forest regression model, the analysis provides a more detailed understanding of the complex relationships between temperature fluctuations, socio-economic factors, and energy consumption. The model's ability to adapt to non-linear interactions allowed it to effectively capture the dynamics of heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), population, and GDP, along with their interactions, which are crucial in contexts with extreme weather variability.
The results demonstrate that the Random Forest model's prediction for 2022 was approximately 36% off from the actual consumption. This deviation reflects the increased electricity demand driven by climate-induced extreme weather events. The actual 2022 consumption was 13.78 million units, compared to the predicted 8.77 million units, underscoring how climate-driven temperature extremes, beyond historical norms, can significantly impact energy needs. Although even advanced models like Random Forest face challenges in accounting for unprecedented climate events, they still represent a substantial improvement over linear models by better handling the relationship between variables.
