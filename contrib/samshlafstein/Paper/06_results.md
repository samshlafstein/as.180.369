**Results**

The Random Forest model was trained on Texas electricity consumption data from 1960 to 1980 and tested using data from 2022 to evaluate its predictive accuracy amid climate-driven temperature variations. Key features in the model included heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), population, and GDP, along with interaction terms to capture complex relationships between climate and socio-economic factors. In 2022, the model predicted Texas electricity consumption to be approximately 8.77 million units, while the actual recorded consumption was 13.78 million units. This discrepancy represents a prediction error of roughly 36%, indicating an increase in energy demand driven by extreme weather conditions.
