**Introduction**

Previous literature has extensively examined the effects of climate change on energy consumption, often using metrics like cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD) to assess variations in heating and cooling needs based on baseline temperatures. Rising global temperatures and increasing climate variability have been shown to drive heightened demand for cooling during warmer months and, in some instances, heating during colder months. Texas, with its independent energy grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and its susceptibility to extreme weather events, provides a unique case for studying the impacts of climate variability on energy consumption.

The 2021 Texas Winter Storm highlighted the limitations of traditional forecasting models, which often rely solely on historical weather data and fail to adequately account for climate variability. For instance, peak load estimates for the storm were underestimated by as much as 22% {cite:t}`impact_lee_2021`. Additionally, economic losses from the event exceeded $130 billion, underscoring vulnerabilities in Texas's grid that were worsened by insufficient preparation for extreme weather {cite:t}`cascading_busby_2021`. These challenges emphasize the importance of incorporating long-term climate trends into models of electricity consumption.

Recent research illustrates the impacts of climate change on energy demand in Texas. Since the mid-20th century, annual demand on the ERCOT grid has risen by 1.8%, driven by both long-term climate trends and short-term variability. This increase, equivalent to an additional 2.0 GW of demand, has also led to higher costs for consumers, with climate change contributing approximately $2.2 billion (28%) of a $7.7 billion rise in electricity costs in 2023 alone {cite:t}`climate_dessler_2024`. These findings underscore the critical need for more advanced and flexible forecasting methods that can account for the dynamic and non-linear effects of climate change on energy consumption.

This paper aims to address these challenges by employing a Random Forest regression model to analyze the effects of climate-induced weather on electricity consumption in Texas. Random Forest offers significant advantages over traditional linear regression models by capturing complex, non-linear relationships and interactions among variables such as HDD, CDD, population, GDP, and a time trend to account for long-term changes. This flexibility enables more accurate modeling of the interplay between climate and socio-economic factors, making it particularly well-suited for Texasâ€™s unique energy landscape. By training the model on historical data from 1960 to 1980 and testing it with data from 2022, this study isolates the impact of climate change on electricity consumption across distinct periods.

By integrating advanced modeling techniques, this paper presents a framework for understanding energy demand dynamics in regions experiencing climate variability, with implications for infrastructure planning, energy policy, and climate resilience initiatives.
