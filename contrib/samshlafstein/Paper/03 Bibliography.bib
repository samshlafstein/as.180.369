               Reducing CO2 emissions through urban governance is an important
               issue. Despite the increasing attention paid on the CO2 emission
               prediction, few studies consider the collective and complex
               influence of governance element system. To predict and regulate
               CO2 emissions through comprehensive urban governance elements,
               this paper use the random forest model through the data from 1903
               Chinese county-level cities in 2010, 2012 and 2015, and establish
               a CO2 forecasting platform based on the effects of urban
               governance elements. The results are as follows: (1) The
               municipal utility facilities element, the economic development \&
               industrial structure element, and the city size \&structure and
               road traffic facilities elements are crucial for residential,
               industrial and transportation CO2 emissions, respectively; (2)
               Governance elements have nonlinear relationship with CO2
               emissions and most of the relations present obvious threshold
               effects; (3) Random forest can be used to predict CO2 emissions
               more accurately than can other predictive models. These findings
               can be used to conducts the CO2 scenario simulation and help
               government formulate active governance measurements.",

               demand has become more responsive to cold temperatures over time.
               This is consistent with the fact electric heating has similarly
               increased over the past 20 years in Texas. We find during the
               February 2021 event, average electricity demand was 8\% higher,
               and approximately 10,000 MW higher during the peak hour, than it
               would have been had temperature sensitivity remained unchanged at
               early 2000s levels. Our results highlight that Texas's increased
               sensitivity to cold weather extremes is not limited to the supply
               side, but the demand side as well. These findings have

               manages the electric power across most of Texas. They make
               short-term assessments of electricity demand on the basis of
               historical weather over the last two decades, thereby ignoring
               the effects of climate change and the possibility of weather
               variability outside the recent historical range. In this paper,
               we develop an empirical method to predict the impact of weather
               on energy demand. We use that with a large ensemble of climate
               model runs to construct a probability distribution of power
               demand on the ERCOT grid for summer and winter 2021. We find that
               the most severe weather events will use 100\% of available
               power—if anything goes wrong, as it did during the 2021 winter,
               there will not be sufficient available power. More
               quantitatively, we estimate a 5\% chance that maximum power
               demand would be within 4.3 and 7.9 GW of ERCOT’s estimate of
               best-case available resources during summer and winter 2021,
               respectively, and a 20\% chance it would be within 7.1 and 17 GW.
               The shortage of power on the ERCOT grid is partially hidden by
               the fact that ERCOTs seasonal assessments, which are based
               entirely on historical weather, are too low. Prior to the 2021
               winter blackout, ERCOT forecast an extreme peak load of 67 GW. In
               reality, we estimate hourly peak demand was 82 GW, 22\% above
               ERCOT’s most extreme forecast and about equal to the best-case
               available power. Given the high stakes, ERCOT should develop
               probabilistic estimates using modern scientific tools to predict
               the range of power demand more accurately.",

               interconnected systems represent a critical infrastructure
               challenge. Seasonal and interannual variability in climate
               variables—primarily precipitation and temperature—can increase
               the vulnerability of such systems during climate extremes. The
               objective of this study is to understand and quantify the role of
               temperature variability on electricity consumption over
               representative areas of the Southern United States. We consider
               two states, Tennessee and Texas, which represent different
               climate regimes and have limited electricity trade with adjacent
               regions. Results from regression tests indicate that regional
               population growth explains most of the variability in electricity
               demand at decadal time scales, whereas temperature explains
               44–67\% of the electricity demand variability at seasonal time
               scales. Seasonal temperature forecasts from general circulation
               models are also used to develop season-ahead power demand
               forecasts. Results suggest that the use of climate forecasts can
               potentially help to project future residential electricity demand
