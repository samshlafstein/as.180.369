Previous literature has examined the effects of climate change on energy consumption by using metrics such as cooling degree days (CDD) and heating degree days (HDD) to evaluate variations in heating and cooling needs based on baseline temperatures. Existing studies have shown that rising global temperatures and increasing climate variability drive a heightened demand for cooling during warmer months and, in some instances, heating during colder months. Texas, with its independent energy grid managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and its susceptibility to extreme weather events, has become a focal point in research on climate change and energy consumption. The unique configuration of Texas’s grid and its exposure to extreme heat and severe winter storms make it a compelling case for studying the effects of climate variability on energy consumption.

Recent findings indicate that climate-induced weather changes have increased electricity demand on the ERCOT grid by approximately 1.8% since the mid-20th century {cite
}Shaffer2022-xu. However, forecasting models from ERCOT have often relied solely on historical weather data, which limits their capacity to incorporate climate variability. The limitations of these models were underscored during the 2021 Texas Winter Storm, when peak load estimates were underestimated by as much as 22% {cite
}Lee2022-op.

This study aims to improve traditional forecasting methods by integrating climate variability into an advanced electricity consumption model. Building on previous work, this paper employs a Random Forest regression model to capture the complex, non-linear relationships between climate indicators—specifically HDD and CDD—and energy consumption. Random Forest is a robust machine learning approach that has proven effective in recent energy studies {cite
}Zhang2023-fx,Parhizkar2021-ku, particularly for managing non-linear dependencies and interactions among variables. This model was applied to a dataset from 1960 to 1980 for training and from 2022 for testing, incorporating HDD, CDD, population, and GDP as key variables to assess climate impacts across two distinct periods.

By comparing the model's predictive accuracy across these timeframes, this paper quantifies the effects of climate change on energy consumption, using root mean square error (RMSE) as a metric for model accuracy. The model’s ability to handle complex data patterns offers a distinct advantage over traditional linear models, providing insights into the degree of deviation attributable to climate change by quantifying the model's prediction error for 2022. By utilizing data across two periods, this paper isolates the effect of long-term climate trends on electricity consumption, controlling for socio-economic factors such as population growth and economic expansion.

The findings of this paper can inform policy decisions that address the risks posed by climate change, including energy infrastructure planning for increased capacity, demand-response programs, and the integration of renewable energy sources. A deeper understanding of the relationship between climate change and electricity consumption is essential for predicting demand spikes and mitigating extreme weather's economic and human costs. This paper contributes to the climate resilience debate by equipping energy infrastructure planning with insights drawn from Texas’s highly variable weather patterns—insights that may apply to energy systems worldwide. Moreover, the Random Forest regression approach employed here provides a new, dynamic framework for modeling climate variability.
