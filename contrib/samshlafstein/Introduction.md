Previous literature has examined the effects of climate change on energy demand using metrics such as cooling degree days and heating degree days to evaluate variations in heating and cooling needs from base temperatures. Existing literature has found the increasing effects of climate change have increased demand for cooling during warmer months and heating during colder months. Texas has been subject to much research attention regarding climate change and energy demand due to its independent energy grid, ERCOT, and susceptibility to extreme weather events. Recent studies have indicated that climate-induced weather changes have increased electricity demand on the ERCOT grid by 1.8% since the mid-20th century (Dessler). Forecasting models from ERCOT have been criticized for only relying on historical weather data that fails to account for climate variability. The 2021 Texas Winter Storm is an extreme example of this, where forecasts underestimated peak load by as much as 22% (Lee and Dessler). This paper fills that gap by incorporating climate variability into a model for electricity demand. Texas is a useful case study for this paper as it experiences extreme heat and severe winter conditions. A deeper understanding of the relationship between climate change and electricity demand is important to better predict demand spikes and mitigate these events' economic and human costs. The paperâ€™s findings can inform policy decisions addressing the increasing risks of climate change and energy infrastructure decisions such as increased capacity, demand-response programs, and renewable energy integration. This paper contributes to the climate resilience debate. It better informs how energy infrastructure can be better equipped, with insights from highly volatile weather in Texas that can be applied to energy systems worldwide. Moreover, the econometric methods employed in this paper provide a dynamic way to model climate variability.
