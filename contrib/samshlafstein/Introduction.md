Previous literature has examined the effects of climate change on energy demand using metrics such as cooling degree days and heating degree days to evaluate variations in heating and cooling needs from base temperatures. Existing literature has found that the increasing effects of climate change have heightened demand for cooling during warmer months and heating during colder months. Texas has been subject to much research attention regarding climate change and energy demand due to its independent energy grid, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), and its susceptibility to extreme weather events. Recent studies have indicated that climate-induced weather changes have increased electricity demand on the ERCOT grid by 1.8% since the mid-20th century (Dessler). Forecasting models from ERCOT have been criticized for relying solely on historical weather data, which fails to account for climate variability. The 2021 Texas Winter Storm is an extreme example of this, where forecasts underestimated peak load by as much as 22% (Lee and Dessler). 

In this paper, I will incorporate climate variability into a model for electricity demand. Using data from 1950 to 2000 and comparing it to 2021–2023, I will estimate electricity demand under two distinct climate periods. By applying a regression model with heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), population, and GDP as control variables, the comparison across these two periods allows us to quantify the effects of climate change. Specifically, I will calculate the root mean square error (RMSE) to measure the model's accuracy in predicting demand across both time periods. This comparison will help reveal how deviations in demand between the two periods can be attributed to climate change, as the second period is expected to show increased demand due to more extreme weather conditions. The RMSE provides a clear way to assess the model’s performance and quantify how much of the increased demand is driven by climate-related factors, such as rising temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events. By comparing the two periods, we can isolate the effect of long-term climate trends on electricity demand while controlling for socio-economic variables like population growth and economic activity.

Texas is a useful case study for this paper as it experiences extreme heat and severe winter conditions. A deeper understanding of the relationship between climate change and electricity demand is important to better predict demand spikes and mitigate these events' economic and human costs. The paper’s findings can inform policy decisions addressing the increasing risks of climate change and energy infrastructure decisions such as increased capacity, demand-response programs, and renewable energy integration. This paper contributes to the climate resilience debate, better informing how energy infrastructure can be equipped with insights from highly volatile weather in Texas, which can be applied to energy systems worldwide. Moreover, the econometric methods employed in this paper provide a dynamic way to model climate variability.
