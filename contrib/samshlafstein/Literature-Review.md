The increasing impacts of climate change and the challenges it poses to energy infrastructure and demand management have garnered significant research attention. An important facet of this research is measuring electricity demand, especially in regions prone to extreme hot and cold weather. Existing literature has largely focused on uses of electricity demand directly connected to climate change, like heating and cooling, as opposed to, say, cooking, which bears little relation to changes in weather (e.g., Mideksa and Kallbekken; Wilbanks et al.).

Previous models have attempted to estimate electricity demand by taking either a bottom-up or top-down approach. Bottom-up approaches construct models using meteorological, industry profiles, demographic, energy consumption data, and other variables to estimate the relationship between temperature and demand. Top-down models typically use regressions, measuring climatic variables against electricity demand. The key independent variables used in these models are heating degree days and cooling degree days, which are compared against a base temperature. The base temperature is classified as the temperature where no heating or cooling is required. Heating degree days are calculated as the sum of negative deviations from the actual temperature compared to the base temperature over a certain time period. Likewise, cooling degree days are the sum of positive deviations from the actual temperature compared to the base temperature (Chandramowli, Felder).

Past studies have used changes in heating and cooling degree days over time, both in average observations and outliers, to evaluate the effects of climate change on electricity demand. However, the magnitude of these effects varies significantly based on the region studied. In this paper, I look at Texas, where geologic records indicate significant climate changes on millennial time scales (Banner et al.). There is scientific consensus that increases in temperature throughout Texas will lead to a more arid, warmer, and drier climate. The severe freezes that occurred in Texas have been the subject of much research effort; however, while this freezing was extreme, it was not unprecedented, with prior freezes happening in 1989, 2003, and 2011 (Busby et al.). The extreme volatility in weather induced by climate change makes Texas a pertinent case study for this paper, allowing for more pronounced effects of temperature on electricity demand.

In 2019, Rastogi et al. looked at how shifts in seasonal climate patterns impacted residential energy consumption across the United States. The authors employed regression models based on state-level EIA energy consumption, PRISM meteorological observations, and state-level population. They used fixed effects to mitigate omitted variable bias, employing state, month, and year fixed effects. In 2021, Cawthorne et al. examined the role of temperature variability on electricity demand in the Southern region of the United States, finding that temperature explains 44-67% of electricity demand in the United States. The authors used a Bayesian regression model and general circulation models to identify the unique effect of climate change on electricity demand, importantly including population growth as a variable to control for in the model.

This paper builds off these models to narrow the focus to Texas electricity demand.
