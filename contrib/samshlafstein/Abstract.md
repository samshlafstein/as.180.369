This paper analyzes the impact of extreme weather events on electricity demand, applying econometric models to assess both historical effects and future projections of temperature variability. It focuses on extreme heat and cold in Texas as a case study, given its independent energy grid (ERCOT) and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in the state. First, the paper uses historical data from 1950 to 2000 and compares it to 2021â€“2023. A regression model is developed that incorporates heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), population, and GDP as control variables, along with interaction terms to account for how population size and economic activity interact with temperature changes. This model allows us to estimate electricity demand during these periods and quantify how climate variability has contributed to increasing demand. By comparing the two periods using the root mean square error (RMSE), the model measures how deviations in electricity demand can be attributed to rising temperatures and more frequent extreme events. Projections are then developed to estimate the potential impact of future extreme weather conditions on electricity demand. The findings show that increases in temperature by X degrees historically led to a Y% rise in electricity demand, with similar projections for future temperature increases. Additionally, decreases in temperature by X degrees have resulted in a Y% rise in electricity demand in the past, with predicted temperature drops yielding similar increases in future demand. This demonstrates the significant effect of extreme weather on energy consumption in Texas, providing important insights for energy policy and infrastructure planning.
