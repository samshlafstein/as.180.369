This paper analyzes the impact of extreme weather events on electricity demand, applying econometric models to understand the historical impact and future projections of erratic temperature. It focuses on extreme heat and cold in Texas as a case study and its relation to electricity demand. Texas is a useful case study due to its independent energy grid (ERCOT) and the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events in the state. First, the paper uses historical data from 2021, the Texas Climate Reports, and reports from the Energy Information Administration to conduct a Vector Autoregression model to evaluate the impact of past extreme heating and cooling on electricity demand. Next, the paper develops an impulse response function to assess the potential effects of temperature variability on future electricity demand. We find that increases in temperature by x degrees have caused a y% rise in energy demand historically, and projections that elevations in temperature by x will lead to a y% increase in electricity demand. Additionally, decreases in temperature by x degrees have led to a y% rise in energy demand in the past, and predicted lowering temperatures by x will cause a y% increase in electricity demand. This, in turn, shows how extreme weather events increase energy consumption.
