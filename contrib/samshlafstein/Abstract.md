This paper analyzes how extreme weather events affect electricity demand in Texas, focusing on extreme heat and cold due to the state's independent energy grid (ERCOT).

It compares historical data from 1950 to 2000 with data from 2021 to 2023 using a regression model that includes heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), population, and GDP. The model assesses how these factors influence electricity demand and uses root mean square error (RMSE) to measure demand deviations related to temperature changes.

Key findings show that increases in temperature by X degrees led to a Y% rise in electricity demand, with similar projections for future increases. Likewise, decreases in temperature by X degrees also resulted in a Y% increase in demand.

This research highlights the significant impact of extreme weather on energy consumption in Texas, providing essential insights for energy policy and infrastructure planning.
