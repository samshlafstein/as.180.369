This paper analyzes how extreme weather events affect electricity consumption in Texas, focusing on extreme heat and cold due to the state's independent energy grid (ERCOT). Using data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) and economic indicators from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), this study compares historical data from 1960 to 1980 with data from 2022 through a Random Forest regression model. The model, which includes heating degree days (HDD), cooling degree days (CDD), population, and GDP, assesses how these factors influence electricity consumption and applies root mean square error (RMSE) to measure deviations related to temperature changes. Key findings show that the modelâ€™s prediction for 2022 was approximately 36% off from actual consumption, underscoring the increased energy demand driven by extreme weather. This research highlights the growing impact of climate-related events on Texas energy needs, providing essential insights for energy policy and infrastructure planning.
